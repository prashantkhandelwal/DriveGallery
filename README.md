DriveGallery
============

Turns Google Drive folder in an online album viewer. Create a folder in your Google Drive which contains images only. 

*Google Drive API is slow. So make sure you don't add many files in the same folder. Instead create folders like volume 1 & volume 2 or part 1 or part 2*

Go to the settings page after you have created the folder and uploaded the images. Enter the name of the folder and click Add Album button to save the name of the folder as album.

Go to home page and click View button to view the images in the folder. Here you can either **View** or **Download** the image.
